### XSS

1. Reflected XSS Example
• Command: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
• Injection Point: A URL parameter that is reflected back in the webpage without sanitization.
• Example Scenario: A search function on a website where the search term is reflected in the results page.◇ User visits: https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS');</script>
◇ The search results page reflects the query in the HTML response: <p>Your search results for: <script>alert('XSS');</script></p>



2. Stored XSS Example
◇ Command: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
◇ Injection Point: A user input field that stores data in the database and is later displayed on the website without proper encoding.
◇ Example Scenario: A comment section on a blog post where comments are displayed to all readers.▪ User submits a comment: <script>alert('XSS');</script>
▪ The comment is stored in the database and displayed to every visitor, executing the script in their browsers.

3. DOM XSS Example
◇ Command: <img src="invalid-image" onerror="alert('XSS');">
◇ Injection Point: JavaScript that writes user input directly to the DOM without proper sanitization.
◇ Example Scenario: A website with a search functionality that dynamically updates the page content based on user input.▪ User enters a search term: <img src="invalid-image" onerror="alert('XSS');">
▪ The website's JavaScript takes this input and dynamically updates the DOM: document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + userInput;
▪ The malicious code is executed when the invalid image fails to load.
